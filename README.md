# Project T Final: Matplotlib and Seaborn 
With a slidedeck, a jupyter notebook assignment, and a quiz, this repo is a full assignment designed such that students that complete it have will full mastery over the visualization tools Matplotlib and Seaborn.
## Learning Objectives
* Develop an understanding of the Matplotlib library and the anatomy of Matplotlib visualizations. Understand plotting in both the object oriented and pyplot perspective.
  * Students get introduced to these concepts in the notes and their conceptual understanding is tested in the quiz section.
* Understand how to use seaborn to make engaging visualizations and use different artists to supplement it. Mastery of seaborn plotting functions.
  * In our notes and our assignment students have a lot of opportunity to play with seaborn. In the assignment, they get a TON of experience with plotting many different graphs and visualizing distributions, relationships, and categories in data.
* Mastery of the use of artists in Matplotlib
  * The assignment makes them use annotations, labels, scaling, and ticks in order to make sure they understand master this important technique well.
* Mastery over making sizing figures and supplying adequate information to make graphs readable
  * In the assignment, there are many instances where students get to resize plots and provide titles and labels for graphs
* Mastery over the FacetGrid object, and multigraph figures
  * The assignment has many different questions that will induce mastery of working with the FacetGrid in seaborn.
  * The assignment makes sure they understand seaborn's different techniques for producing multigraph figures.
* Deep understanding of figure and axes level plotting in seaborn
  * Our assignment requires students to use both figure level and axes level plots, and our notes make this distinction a fixture to make sure they understand the two types of plotting functions in seaborn.
* Exposure to working with images in Matplotlib
  * Our notes give students a pretty good exposure to matplotlib's image libraries and allow them to be ready for using matplotlib for image processing.
